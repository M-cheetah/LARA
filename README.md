# Flood-alerting
an open source project for alerting when there are the conditions for flood, so your suggestions and contributions are welcomed

# Abstract:-
There are lots of works going on in the field of IOT and people are trying to push  the limits of IOT to make it possible for it to solve almost every problem present on the surface, one of such probems is the problem of sudden floods, they come and wipe out a huge range of living matter present in their way, hence there should be a proper technology which can alert us at the right time so that we can take suitable steps at right time.
	in this report we've presented such a device named as LARA (Level-Acknowledging-&-Realtime-Alerting) device which can alert when there will be flood conditions and can even predict it by using suitable ML algorithms. LARA is a device that uses HCSR-04 sensor data to send tweets when the specific conditions are met. You can find two files in here, one is deployed in IBM and other is deployed in Thingspeak, remember that both of them are individual deployments and are not corelated at all.
# Motivation:-
Although it was given us as a mini project but we took it like an opportunity to make a better fluctuation in traditional ways and the way most of the scholars look at the projects, like they are just burdens on them.
	We’ve seen these kind of problems in Uttrakhand, people go really close to the water to check if it’s at or above  dangerous levels or not, this can cost serious damage to life, hence we tried our best to make it.
